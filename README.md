## Installation and Usage

0. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishu7im/AdmitEase.git

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders: `client` and `server`.

### Client

The `client` folder contains the front-end part of the application built with React. It provides an intuitive user interface for managing admissions and interacting with the system.

To set up and run the client:

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install client dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The client application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Server

The `server` folder contains the back-end part of the application. It handles data storage, management, and communication with the client.

To set up and run the server:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install server dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and set up your environment variables (e.g., database connection, server port).

4. Start the server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will run on the port you specified in the `.env` file.
